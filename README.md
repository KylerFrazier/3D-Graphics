Hahah, space picture go brrrrr
# But how do I run this?
Use CMake and Make to get things set up. The output file is called `render`. For example:
  * git clone *this repo*
  * cd *dir of this repo*
  * mkdir build
  * cd build
  * cmake ..
  * make
  * ./render
# Prerequisites
  * OpenGL
  * Glut (library for OpenGL)
